## First part: present the lab and the architecture (briefly)
Hello and welcome to a new subject. In this video, you will understand what is expected of you and how to use the projects files you have been given.

During this lab, you will discover a new architecture: the dsPIC33.
More than a simple CPU like the RISC16 was, the dsPIC33 is a full fledged micro-controller.
The main difference being that a microcontroller *contains* a CPU, amongst other modules and peripherals, such as converters, memory or communication protocols.

All along this session, you will simulate this architecture using an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE, called MPLab.
It's being published by Microchip, the manufacturer of the dsPIC, and offers lots of tools allowing you to observe and analyse the behaviour of your code.
We will dive into the handling of MPLab a bit latter.

To successfuly reach the end of the handout, try following the questions in the order they are asked.
Some questions will need you to browse the documentation, others to read and analyse source files and finaly, some will expect you to actually run code in MPLab.
But you will read it in the handout, let's take a closer look at MPLab.
